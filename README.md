# UtilsJS

This library is a collection of utilities that I use across all my Node.js projects.

I try to avoid adding here code that is too specific to one kind of project. My aim
is to add things that I wish that the Node.js modules already had.

This library has zero dependencies.

## Usage 

Install the package:

```
npm install --save @gaumala/utils
```

Then read the docs at https://gaumala.github.io/utilsJS/

## Release 

To release a new version run:

```
node pack.js
npm publish --access=public dist/
```
